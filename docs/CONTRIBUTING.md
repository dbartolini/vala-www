# Contributor Guide

Please make sure that you are following the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

The easiest ways to contribute are to: [create a new issue](https://github.com/vala-lang/vala-www/issues/new/choose) or participate in [discussions](https://github.com/vala-lang/vala-www/discussions).

If you would like to contribute code, please try to do the following:

1. Fork the project
2. Create a new branch to solve a particular issue (or multiple issues if they are small or closely related).
3. When you are ready to submit the code, make a pull request to the `main` branch.
4. Try to [reference issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) so they can be automatically closed when the changes merged into the `main` branch.
5. Make your pull request a draft if you think that there's needs to be regular feedback on the code as it's being developed.

To deploy the website, push to the `deploy` branch (preferrably from the `main` branch).
